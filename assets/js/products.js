        infomation: `<p>As a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you
        must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to
        withstand the elements. Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame & breed the leviathan dinosaurs and
        other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive,
        dominate... and escape!</p></br>
        <img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/TameTrainBreedRide.png?t=1608086122"></br></br>
        <p>Dinosaurs, Creatures, & Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&-affinity
        process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health
        with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on
        how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry
        Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and
        larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift
        allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a
        gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem
        life-cycle with its own predator & prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species
        struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively
        breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process
        includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies!</p></br>

        <p>You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants & meat having different nutritional
        properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing
        concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with
        subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized
        weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you
        to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable
        clothing & armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage & extreme temperatures using the
        dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system!</p></br>

        <p>By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the
        parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps,
        beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and
        all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall
        apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and
        items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable
        signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and
        provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing & armor gear can also be painted to express
        your own visual style.</p></br>

        <p>Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and
        nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and
        some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare
        fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find
        the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians & vegans can flourish, and it
        will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner!</p></br>
        <p>By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the
        one of the ARK’s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide
        an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely
        valuable progression items if they are defeated.</p></br>

        <p>Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your
        Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins
        to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village!</p></br>

        <p>All items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding
        resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest
        mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through
        performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new "Engrams" to be able to craft Items from memory without
        the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye,
        and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you'll find clues
        left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D
        "Explorer Notes". By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and
        discover its purpose!</p></br>

        <p>Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the
        game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on
        your character in the world. Everything can be looted & stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up,
        team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and
        force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions,
        harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames!</p></br>

        <p>The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures,
        above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic
        procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically
        updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively
        detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through
        exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring
        with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text & voice chat, or long-distance radio.
        Construct & draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray... And yet.. how do you
        ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned.</p></br>

        leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK's by accessing the
        Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly
        different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be
        unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items!
        Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique 'Procedurally Generated ARKs', for infinite
        replayability and endless surprises.</p></br>

        From Charles Cecil, creator of the Broken Sword series, with art direction by Dave Gibbons, legendary comic
        book artist behind ‘Watchmen’, comes ‘Beyond A Steel Sky’, the long awaited sequel to the cult classic

        <p>You are Robert Foster. A child has been abducted in a brutal attack. You have vowed to bring him home. The

        wars, and political meltdown.</p></br>
        <p>Union City is a utopia, its people loving life under the control of an altruistic AI: ever-attentive
        androids, designer living, piazzas and bars. What’s not to love? But this City has a dark underbelly...</p></br>
        <p>‘Beyond a Steel Sky’ is a dramatic, humorous, cyberpunk thriller in which engaging puzzles drive a
        fast-paced narrative set in a dynamic gameworld that responds to – and is subverted by – the player’s
        actions.</p></br>

        player can subvert. In combination with a unique hacking tool, multiple solutions to puzzles emerge from
        player choices.</p></br>

        <p>Two years ago you – a rookie agent of ATOM – were sent on a dangerous mission into the Soviet Wastes. As a
        result, you uncovered certain information about a new threat that can potentially destroy the struggling
        remnants of humanity.</p></br>
        <p>In ATOM RPG: Trudograd your goal is to travel to a giant post-apocalyptic metropolis that withstood the
        tests of nuclear obliteration and social collapse. There you must find what is thought to be humanity’s last
        hope in fending off the menace from outer space!</p></br>

        - Ability to transfer your hero from our previous game (ATOM RPG);</br>
        - An easy game to pick up. While Trudograd is a continuation of the first game’s plot, it is also friendly towards
        new players, and will quickly fill you in on the lore and major developments you might have missed;</br>
        - A result of a two year long community effort, made by players for players. This game encompasses a lot of
        changes from our previous title, that were inspired by user feedback.</p></br></br>
